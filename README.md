  This project focuses on the development and comparison of multiple AI models designed to play the game of Battleship. The primary objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of different AI strategies, including a Random AI, Exploratory Local Search AI, Probabilistic AI, Monte Carlo AI, and Reinforcement Learning AI, in terms of their performance in sinking all enemy ships with the fewest amount guesses needed.
  Each AI model was rigorously tested, and the results demonstrated that all models outperformed the baseline Random AI, with the Probabilistic AI emerging as the most effective. Specifically, the Probabilistic AI achieved the best average performance, requiring fewer strikes to win the game, while maintaining a balanced variance. The Monte Carlo AI and Reinforcement Learning AI models showed comparable results, though with a higher variance in their outcomes, particularly in scenarios that closely matched their respective heuristic or training data causing overperforming outliers.
  The analysis of these models highlights the strengths and limitations of various AI approaches in strategic decision-making. The Probabilistic AI's superior performance highlights its ability to balance exploration and exploitation effectively, leading to more consistent success in the game. The findings from this study offer valuable insights into the design and optimization of AI for complex, incomplete information games like Battleship, and suggest potential avenues for further improvement and development.
